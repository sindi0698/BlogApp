VALUES ('Kohei Yoshiyuki, Voyeuristic Photographer with a Cult Following, Dies at 76', 'Kohei Yoshiyuki, whose snapshots of Tokyo’s hedonistic after-hours culture emblematized a certain sensibility in postwar Japan, has died at 76. His longtime gallery, New York’s Yossi Milo Gallery, announcer Yoshiyuki’s death on Saturday, writing, “Yoshiyuki’s photographs remind us that the conflict between private and public is timeless, something we all must grapple with in every aspect of our lives.”
With a 35mm camera in hand, Yoshiyuki positioned himself on the edges of nightlife during the 1970s. For his most famous series, “The Park,” he chronicled clandestine hookups in the city’s public spaces. The focus was more often on the men who lurked in periphery, thrilled by the spectacle. In some images, fully dressed men watch fornicating couples. In others, the lurkers are caught unbuttoning their pants or reaching out a hand. It’s unclear how cognizant the couples are of their audience.',

School leaders will tell a parliamentary briefing on Wednesday that a pay freeze, soaring workload and a mental health and wellbeing crisis are acting as deterrents to the next generation of headteachers.',

       ('Meet Aoi Yamada, the Avant-Garde Dancer the Fashion World Can’t Get Enough Of',
        'True originals are hard to come by, but Aoi Yamada certainly qualifies. The Tokyo-based 21-year-old self-described “dancer, model, and expresser” is instantly recognizable. Not just because of her movements, but also owing to her avant garde performance looks, which could be anything from a leotard printed with Matsumoto Castle to a hairstyle that looks like a thatched Japanese roof. This sui generis effect makes her hard to forget. Likely, that’s why she’s already worked with Stella McCartney, modeled for Fred Perry, and, most notably, performed a solo dance at the closing ceremony of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo last summer. For the latter, she wore a bedazzled headpiece and a jacket made of paper thin strips of green and brown fabric; when she spun, she looked like a brush in a carwash.',

',
        'Superman & Lois blew some minds when its Doomsday reveal turned out to be iconic supervillain Bizarro. Bizarro made a big splash in this episode, though there’s still a lot we don’t know about this latest incarnation of the superhero. Like, I thought I knew where Bizarro came from, but the latest episode just hurt my prevailing theory that Bizarro is the result of testing by Lieutenant Mitchell Anderson (who replaced Lois’ occasionally shady father) and the United States military.',
